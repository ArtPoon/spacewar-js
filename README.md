# spacewar-js

[Spacewar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!) was one of the earliest video games ever made.  Although it was originally implemented on the [PDP-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-1), many of us grew up playing a more recent implementation in DOS.  This repo is a hobby code project to make a similar game using the JavaScript framework [matter-js](http://brm.io/matter-js/).

It is currently a two-player game.  I'm not sure how I'd implemented an AI yet.
